This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens in functional components before the first render, or if you try to access a state variable asynchronously before it has had time to update.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      console.log(count); // Might log 'undefined'
      setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
}
```
